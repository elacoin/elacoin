Elacoin - an elastic cryptocurrency
===================================

Hardfork Notice: Elacoin will switch to Scrypt-N Adaptive and KGW at August 15th, 2014 00:00:00 GMT!

Elastic block reward algorithm based on the difficulty and Moore's Law
The more computational power you throw at it, the more each block will give. 
The reward is halved every nine months to preserve the coin's value.

Stable Currency that Regulates Itself Through Supply and Demand
Less demand? Less hashpower, less block reward, less supply. Same value.
High demand? More hashpower, more block reward, more supply. Same value.

Fast Payments and Confirmations
The block target is one every 2 minutes, which is the perfect amount.
Fast enough without running into network IO limits, or bloating your hard drive.

Open to everyone. No premining, no shenanigans, announced release
Elacoin will be released after 24 hours of this message. Elacoin is not premined,
with the genesis block timestamping "Traffic from Syria Disappears from Internet".
